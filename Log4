Got a lot done today! Mainly just personal projects, but I was able to add lots of content to my personal website.
I still need to make a main page, but for the time being I have a favourite movies page.
I created a css for Whiplash, which was previoulsy just using the <style> tags in html
  The css really makes things more concise and easy to work with
I also created a new webpage that showcases all of the posters for my favourite movies
  each image will be a hyperlink to an individual page that contains my thoughts on the movie, much like the Whiplash one
I also figured out how to work with icon libraries and implemented one into the Whiplash page to act as a home button
All in all, I leared a lot of new skills and I'm excited to see what else I will learn!
