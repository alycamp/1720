Forgot to upload in a while! Here's What I've been doing
- Experimenting with CSS (cascading style sheets) in HTML for 1012
- Completed part one of lab 2 (1012) which requires the combination of an html file and a css file (student forum)
  - At first, everything seemed fine but when I clicked submit, the information put into the textboxes did not show up on the submission page
    - I fixed this by adding a name attribute next to the insert class: <insert type="text" name="firstName"> and everything worked perfectly!
  - For some reason the CSS only applies to the webpage when in Google Chrome, I can't get it to work in firefox no matter how much I mess around
    with secret settings or the web developer tools.
  - Also, the formatting was a little off at first because I misconstrued where the name class was supposed to go. Instead of putting it next to the  
    input class (as mentioned in line 5), I had first replaced "fieldName" with "firstName" (and subsequently all other name attributes that I was
    instructed to do):
    
    <p> <span class="fieldName">First Name: </span>
	    <input type="text" name="firstName">
      
  - This resulted in the textboxes not being aligned properly as "fieldName" is used in the CSS for the webpage and decides on the margins. With "fieldName"
    not present, the textboxes auto-aligned in a staggered sort of position (all based on the length of the text)
  - Regardless, most of my coding was done over the course of a few days with this lab project. I'm proud that I was able to work out the discrepancies and
    make my file look the same as the example
  - Although, still don't know why it won't work in firefox.....
  - I haven't been able to get to it yet, but I'm also working on my own side project which is basically a personal portfolio of all of my interests and favourite things
    - So far, I've created one page for one of my favourite movies, but I want to make a seperate CSS file to add formatting instead of it being in the html file.
    - I also want to eventually create more pages and explore the use of hyperlinks so that I can have a cohesive website!
